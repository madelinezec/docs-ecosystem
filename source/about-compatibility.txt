MongoDB Compatibility Tables
============================

We include compatibility tables for each version of the driver to guide
your decisions on what versions you need to ensure your environment
remains fully operational.

We maintain the following tables for each driver:

- :ref:`MongoDB compatibility <mongodb-compatibility-tables>`
- :ref:`Language compatibility <language-compatibility-tables>`

Read the sections below for detailed explanations of each table.

.. _mongodb-compatibility-tables:

MongoDB Compatibility Tables
----------------------------

In the **MongoDB Compatibility** tables, the columns are labeled with
versions of MongoDB server and the rows are labeled with major release
versions of the driver.

The check marks (✓) indicate that the driver can access **all the
features** of that specific version of MongoDB server unless those features
have been deprecated or removed.

If you are upgrading your server or driver version, you can use this table
to identify which version of the driver you need to access all the newest
features included in that version of the server.

We recommend that you use the latest driver version that supports your
server version. We also recommend that you avoid using older versions of
the drivers that do not appear on the chart because they are unsupported.

.. note::

   Although the drivers do not advertise compatibility with the versions of
   the server released after them, they are usually interoperable.

.. _language-compatibility-tables:

Language Compatibility Tables
-----------------------------

In the **Language Compatibility** tables, the columns are labeled with
versions of the language (e.g. Node.js, Python, etc.) and the rows are
labeled with major release versions of the driver.

The check marks (✓) indicate that the code in the driver is fully
compatible with the version of the language.
